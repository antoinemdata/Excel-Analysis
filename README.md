# Excel Analysis: weather temperature analysis

It was the first step to the data analyst training. All the weather data was from 19th century to 2013 and we could argue that things got much worse since. The database was given in the Udacity platform and all we had to do is to request global and Bern data through SQL requests.

## Database
Two sheets of the Excel file give the data I could analyse. It was very simple: city, temperature, and year. What we needed to do was to show trends in the Bern and Global data, as well as the mix of Bern and Global data (so the first step to be a good data analyst).

## Mission and objective
As explained before, we needed to see the graphic and numbers trends and to show 4 things we could conclude based on the data.
My objective was to follow this step to become a good data analyst and to better understand Global Warming.
